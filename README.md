# Hello

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).

## More Instructions

There are two different ways to run it:
   * By entering [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000), the main page is displayed.
   * In the main page, click "Click to see the Hello Message!!!". This displays the hello message.
   * Once [`localhost:4000/hello`](http://localhost:4000/hello) is displayed in the search bar, type in anything
   with a forward slash and the message changes to whatever is typed after the forward slash.
